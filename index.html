          PageSprout is about the <strong>philosophy of design</strong>. How simple can we make it? How effective can it be?

          A system that's perfect for your clients, your business or even your own personal site is what's in store. It's Designed For Humans&trade;.

          Unlike other Rails-based CMS's, we're not trying to break out of the Rails way. If you want to extend our CMS, you don't have to worry about use special rake tasks or worrying about conflicting with the CMS' setup. We also make it easy for you to keep your behind-the-scenes areas in-line with ours, for a more consistent design.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Our aim is to build <strong>a free, simple, extensible</strong> CMS aimed at human beings.

        <p>We love open source culture! Now it's our turn to contribute something.</p>
        
        <p>We're releasing our specially-crafted CMS through <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> to the public <strong>very soon</strong>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>We want you</strong> to have your say, fork your own copies and help us in our quest to take a simplicity-inspired CMS wrapped in Rails goodness to the mainstream!</p>
        
        <p>We're still young, but we're committed to trying to bring you the best of our own efforts and combine them with the developers from all-over.</p>
        
        <p>
          Check back when we've launched (very shortly!) to get more information on how you can help.
